# breast-cancer-detection
Breast cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) automates the analysis of mammogram images, identifying patterns like tumors or microcalcifications. CNNs, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet, provide high accuracy, early detection, and reduced human error, improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes in breast cancer screening.
